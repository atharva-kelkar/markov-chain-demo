    "\n",
    "A protein can exist in 3 states as shown below - \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A \"good\" state - in which it performs all of its functions (^_^)\n",
    "2. A \"neutral\" state - the protein does no harm in this state but does not perform its known functions (-_-)\n",
    "3. A \"diseased\" state - the protein in this state causes a disease (⌣̩̩́_⌣̩̩̀)\n",

    "\n",
    "We wish to study the behaviour of the protein with various drugs administered to the patient\n",

    "1. \"_Administer_\" a drug to the protein\n",
    "2. Study how the protein behaves when the drug is administered\n",
    "3. Find out which drug is the best!"
